### Michael, what is Smiling School?

I don't Know :sweat_smile:.

Holberton Smiling school is a wiki so to speak of smiles, in it we can find smiles of all kinds, of all genres, from anywhere in the world, it is a webapp with a quite complete and pleasant design, simple to use and where we can see what we are looking for today on all web pages.

You can see in Github Pages

1. [Homepage](https://tzstrikeryt.github.io/holberton-smiling-school/homepage.html)
2. [Pricing](https://tzstrikeryt.github.io/holberton-smiling-school/pricing.html)
3. [Courses](https://tzstrikeryt.github.io/holberton-smiling-school/courses.html)


The 3 web pages that you see in the previous links complement the development of a complete web page, with a price table, with searches either through a search bar or through labels established in the application, on this web page we can also see a Element that all web pages have, such as adding the authorship of the developers who designed this web page (which I only put because I really did it), it also contains a FAQ section and therefore its main page, developments like this we can use it in different ways forms and it is a completely responsive design so that it is more pleasant to the user when using it on any device.
